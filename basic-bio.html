      <p>My name is Daniel Gallagher, but please call me Dan!  I am a 27 year old webdev in training through the Georgia Tech Full Stack Flex Coding Bootcamp.  I like to spend my time playing video games, both with friends and solo, and watching The Crimson Tide.  I love food, especially Korean BBQ, and am always down for a bowl of Pho.  Currently I reside in Dunwoody, GA, across from Perimeter Mall.  Traffic isn't great, but I still like it.  I like to watch anime, favorites are Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood and The Seven Deadly Sins.  I'm pretty laid back, but I am here to get my career energized!</p>
